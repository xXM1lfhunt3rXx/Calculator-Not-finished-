# Calculator-Not-finished-
It's a simple calculator where the user can give as an input a string of operations (Ex: 5+2*4/2-1 ), and then by pressing =, it gives the final result.

Parenthesis are not implemented yet, and there is a problem with sign operations, Ex: 5--1, -5+-5.
Operations with - are giving some problems, Ex: -1+1, 9/-1, -9/-1, -9/1.
